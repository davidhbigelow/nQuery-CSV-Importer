nQuery-CSV-Importer
===================

This is a (very basic) Tcl based object oriented CSV cypher script generator for neo4j.

After much frustration learning to write cypher scripts for the purposes of importing CSV files into neo4j, this library was written to quickly define import properties and have a cypher script generated (and optionally executed) to import data from a CSV file into neo4j.

The current implementaiton is BASIC - it has a few nice tricks built into it, but fundamentally, it is intended for first time creation / imports of CSV data into neo4j.  Other capabilties will be added in the future (e.g. updating and relationship creation).

Why TCL?!

- easy to learn
- easy to use
- typeless scripting
- object oriented
- it works
- it is standard install on OSX and Linux
- it is what I know the best.. :)
